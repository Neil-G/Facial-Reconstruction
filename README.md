Facial-Reconstruction
=====================

Least Squares Regression Facial Reconstruction

Using a training data set of 11,000 64×64 grayscale images of faces, and a testing data set of the left half (only) of 1,233 other 64×64 images, the task is to reconstruct the right hand sides of the faces of the testing data images using linear least squares regression.  The images come from the labeled faces in the wild project (http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/)
